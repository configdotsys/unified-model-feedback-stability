# A Unified Physical Model of Feedback Stability in Control Theory

*An engineering white paper presenting a conceptual synthesis of a working control model.*

---

This repository presents an independent engineering white paper defining a unified physical model of feedback stability in linear control systems.

The document integrates state–space dynamics, eigenvalues, pole locations, characteristic equations, and Nyquist analysis into a single internally consistent framework for reasoning about stability.

The emphasis is on understanding how multiple mathematical representations describe the same underlying system behavior, rather than on controller synthesis or tuning procedures.

## Scope

The material addresses:

* open-loop instability and right-half-plane modes  
* the relationship between eigenvalues and pole locations  
* the role of the closed-loop characteristic equation in stability  
* the physical interpretation of Nyquist encirclement  
* how feedback suppresses or reinforces unstable dynamics

## Intended Audience

This work is intended for engineers and advanced students with prior exposure to linear control theory who seek a coherent mental model connecting time-domain behavior and frequency-domain stability analysis.

---

## Use

The document is intended as a technical reference to support analysis, interpretation, and implementation of feedback systems across multiple representations.
