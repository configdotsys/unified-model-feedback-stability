# Unified Model of Feedback Stability

This repository contains a technical reference document presenting a unified physical model of feedback stability in linear control systems.

The document synthesizes multiple analytical representations – state-space dynamics, eigenvalues, pole locations, characteristic equations, and Nyquist analysis – into a single internally consistent framework for reasoning about stability.

The emphasis is not on controller design or tuning, but on understanding how different mathematical views of feedback describe the same underlying system behavior.

### Scope

The material focuses on:

* open-loop instability and right-half-plane modes  
* the relationship between eigenvalues and poles  
* the role of the closed-loop characteristic equation  
* the physical meaning of Nyquist encirclement  
* how feedback suppresses or reinforces unstable dynamics

### Intended Audience

This repository is written for engineers and students with prior exposure to linear control theory who are seeking a coherent mental model connecting time-domain behavior and frequency-domain stability analysis.

### Notes

This work reflects a synthesis effort developed to preserve understanding across representations, rather than to introduce new theory or alternative formulations.
